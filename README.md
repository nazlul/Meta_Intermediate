# Metacrafters - Solidity Intermediate - Final Project

## Description
This is the final project for Module 3 - Intermediate Solidity, which implements a smart contract that creates a new token and allows the owner to mint tokens in it. The project provides a practical application of the concepts learned throughout the module.

## Tasks Completed
The following tasks have been completed in this project:
1. Creating a new token on the Ethereum network.
2. Implementing a smart contract that allows the owner to mint tokens in the new token.
3. Testing the smart contract using Remix IDE or other compatible tools.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow the instructions below:
1. GoTo (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Open Remix IDE and create a new file.
3. Copy and paste the code of the smart contract into the file.
4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the smart contract on a local blockchain or on a testnet.
6. Test the smart contract by interacting with it using Remix IDE or other compatible tools.
